Importing the project:

1) Pull the project from https://github.com/chan200v/ense470_webapp

2) Import the project to eclipse

If you want the project to work on your localhost you'll need to do a little bit more:

1) Go to Eclipse Market Place, download and install "JBoss Tool"
After that, press Alt + F5, mark "Force update of snapshot/releases" check box, then click Ok
The project should have no erros or warnings at this moment, if it does maybe its missing some jar

2) Set up data base
2.1) You need to have MySQL server installed on your computer.
If you dont have it, you can download from here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

2.2) I also recommend to install MySQL Workbench, I'm pretty sure it comes if the MySQL server
If it doesn't you can download Workbench from here: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
Since you have it installed open it, go to your local server (You should've configurated it during the MySQL server instalation)
And create a schema called ense470

2.3) Go to eclipse scr/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml

In the configuration section you need to put your useraname and password from sql server
<!-- Configuring the connection to MySQL DataBase-->
<property name="connection.driver_class">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>
<property name="connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost/ense470</property>
<property name="connection.username">your mysql server user</property>
<property name="connection.password">your mysql server password</property>

In action to be performed changed "validate" to "create"
<!-- Action type performed by Hibernate -->
<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">validate</property>

2.4) Go to scr/teste/java/...util/HibernateTestUtil.java
Comment the "ignore" annotation and press Alt+ Shift + X then T (Run as Junit test)
If test succeed, it'll create all the tables in the database
Uncomment "Ignore" annotation

2.5) Go back to scr/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml
In action to be performed changed "create" to "validate"
<!-- Action type performed by Hibernate -->
<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>

2.6) Now your database is created, but there is no data inside, so copy everthing from inserts.txt file in workbench and run it.

2.7) Now it should be working, go to src/main/webapp/pages right click any of then and Run -> Run on Server and application should start
