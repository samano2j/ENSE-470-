Let's go throught the main folders/files that we have in the project.

1) src/main/java

1.1) Bean Layer
Backend to system. For each page that we have in our application we create a bean class to manage it, and hold users information.

1.2) DAO
Classes that access the database, we have a generic DAO with somo generic functions commum to all classes.
If we need something specific for a class, we extends from generic domain and implements the search that is required
